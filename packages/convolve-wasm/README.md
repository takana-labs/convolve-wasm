# @takana-labs/convolve-wasm

Browser-side stereo audio convolution backed by a Rust/WebAssembly DSP core and a dedicated module worker.

## Install from JSR

```bash
npx jsr add @takana-labs/convolve-wasm
```

```ts
import { CONVOLVE } from "@takana-labs/convolve-wasm";

const result = await CONVOLVE({ a: fileA, b: fileB });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(result.wav);
```

v0.1.1 performs a device-aware, post-decode memory preflight before worker creation. Unsafe work rejects with `INPUT_TOO_LARGE` and byte/frame details; the independent 256 MiB Rust/WASM guard remains active.

The package includes its worker and WebAssembly assets. Consumers should import only from the package root; no CDN, upload service, or server-side audio processing is required.
